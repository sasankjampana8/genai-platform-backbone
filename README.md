# CloudRAG Agent — OpenAI + pgvector Serverless RAG Chatbot

CloudRAG Agent is a single document-grounded chatbot product built on AWS serverless infrastructure. It uses OpenAI for embeddings and answer generation, PostgreSQL pgvector for vector search, and AWS API Gateway, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, SQS, and RDS for the backend.

The current working stage is the RAG backbone plus a Next.js chat UI. The next planned upgrade is a production-style `/v1` API with Cognito authentication, chat/conversation/message APIs, memory, run traces, and observability.

CloudRAG is not a no-code agent builder, agent publishing platform, or user-defined tool marketplace. It is one configurable RAG chatbot that can be deployed, tested, destroyed, and rebuilt cleanly.

## Current Stage

Current working capabilities:

- Generate S3 presigned POST data for PDF/DOCX upload.
- Upload documents directly to S3.
- Store document metadata in DynamoDB.
- Queue async processing through SQS.
- Extract text from PDF/DOCX.
- Chunk extracted text.
- Generate embeddings with OpenAI.
- Store chunks and embeddings in PostgreSQL pgvector.
- Retrieve relevant chunks by semantic search.
- Generate grounded OpenAI answers with citations.
- Deploy/destroy the AWS stack with CloudFormation and GitHub Actions.
- Run a Next.js UI that can upload, process, and ask questions against documents.

Planned `/v1` production upgrade:

- Cognito authentication.
- Authenticated document APIs that derive `user_id` from JWT claims.
- Chat, message, run, memory, and trace metadata.
- Async runtime worker for chat messages.
- Internal orchestration for direct, RAG, web, chart, and hybrid routes.
- OpenTelemetry-style tracing with optional external export.
- Compatibility wrapper for the current ask-style flow.

## Architecture Flow

Upload URL API -> direct S3 upload -> DynamoDB document metadata -> Start Processing API -> SQS -> worker Lambda -> text extraction -> chunking -> OpenAI embeddings -> PostgreSQL pgvector -> retrieval -> grounded answer with citations.

Planned `/v1` chat flow:

Auth -> upload document -> process document -> create chat -> send message -> runtime queue -> runtime worker -> memory load -> retrieval -> optional tool context -> OpenAI answer -> assistant message -> run summary -> trace JSON in S3.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local work and fill in:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `PG_HOST`, `PG_PORT`, `PG_DATABASE`, `PG_USER`, `PG_PASSWORD`
- AWS names such as `RAW_BUCKET`, `USER_TABLE`, `DOCUMENT_TABLE`, `PROCESS_JOB_TABLE`, and `PROCESS_QUEUE_URL`
- Cognito values such as `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` and `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`

Install dependencies:

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Local-First Development

Run SQL setup against local PostgreSQL or RDS with the project helper:

```bash
python scripts/setup_pgvector_schema.py
```

Or with `psql`:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f sql/create_pgvector_extension.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f sql/create_document_chunks_table.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f sql/create_indexes.sql
```

Check DB connectivity:

```bash
python scripts/test_db_connection.py
```

Process one file locally:

```bash
python scripts/local_process_document.py local_data/raw/sample.pdf \
  --user-id user_123 \
  --document-id doc_local_001
```

Test retrieval:

```bash
python scripts/local_retrieval_test.py \
  --user-id user_123 \
  --query "What is this document about?" \
  --document-ids doc_local_001 \
  --top-k 5
```

Test final answer generation:

```bash
python scripts/local_ask_test.py \
  --user-id user_123 \
  --query "Summarize this document." \
  --document-ids doc_local_001
```

## Chat UI

The Next.js frontend lives in `frontend/`.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

The UI currently includes:

- Chat workspace.
- Document store panel.
- Settings panel.
- File upload through the backend presigned upload API.
- Start-processing action.
- Process status polling.
- Ask flow through the current answer API.
- Citation chips.

## AWS Resources Required

Use region `ap-south-1` and prefix `cloudrag-mvp`.

- S3 bucket: `cloudrag-mvp-documents-<account-id>-ap-south-1`
- DynamoDB table: `cloudrag_documents`, partition key `document_id`
- DynamoDB table: `cloudrag_process_jobs`, partition key `process_id`
- SQS queue: `cloudrag-processing-queue`
- SQS DLQ: `cloudrag-processing-dlq`
- RDS PostgreSQL with pgvector
- API Gateway HTTP API: `cloudrag-mvp-api`
- Lambda functions for upload URL, document status, start process, process status, worker, retrieval, and ask

## CloudFormation + GitHub Actions

This repo includes CloudFormation and GitHub Actions for repeatable MVP deployments.

Files:

- `infra/cloudformation/bootstrap-github-oidc.yaml`
- `infra/cloudformation/cloudrag-mvp.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudrag-mvp.yml`
- `.github/workflows/destroy-cloudrag-mvp.yml`
- `scripts/package_lambdas.sh`

The main stack creates the stage-1 RAG backbone:

- S3 raw document bucket
- Cognito User Pool and app client for `/v1/auth/*`
- DynamoDB users table
- DynamoDB document metadata table
- DynamoDB process jobs table
- SQS processing queue and DLQ
- RDS PostgreSQL database
- VPC/subnets/security group for the public MVP database
- IAM roles for Lambda
- Lambda functions
- SQS event source mapping for the worker
- HTTP API Gateway routes

It also deploys the code paths for:

- Cognito signup, confirmation, login, refresh, and logout
- Presigned upload URL generation
- Document metadata/status
- SQS async processing
- PDF/DOCX text extraction
- Chunking
- OpenAI embeddings
- pgvector insertion
- Retrieval
- LLM answer generation with citations

### MVP Networking Note

For the lowest-cost MVP, Lambdas are not placed inside a VPC. That lets them call OpenAI without a NAT Gateway. To let those public Lambdas and the GitHub runner connect to RDS, the workflow accepts `db_ingress_cidr`.

For quick experiments, use:

```text
0.0.0.0/0
```

This is convenient but not production-safe. Delete the stack when done. For production, move RDS private and use Lambda in VPC with NAT Gateway, ECS/Fargate, or another controlled egress design.

### One-Time Bootstrap

Deploy the bootstrap stack once from your local machine or AWS CloudShell. It creates:

- GitHub OIDC deploy role
- S3 artifact bucket for Lambda ZIP files

Example:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file infra/cloudformation/bootstrap-github-oidc.yaml \
  --stack-name cloudrag-github-bootstrap \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region ap-south-1 \
  --parameter-overrides \
    GitHubOrg=sasankjampana8 \
    GitHubRepo=agentic-rag-aws \
    ArtifactBucketName=cloudrag-mvp-artifacts-285870986996-ap-south-1 \
    CreateGitHubOidcProvider=true
```

If your AWS account already has the GitHub OIDC provider, set:

```text
CreateGitHubOidcProvider=false
```

Then get outputs:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name cloudrag-github-bootstrap \
  --region ap-south-1 \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs"
```

### GitHub Secrets And Variables

Repository secrets:

```text
AWS_GITHUB_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN
OPENAI_API_KEY
DB_PASSWORD
```

Repository variables:

```text
CFN_ARTIFACT_BUCKET
```

Do not store AWS access keys if using OIDC. The official `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action recommends OIDC so GitHub receives short-lived AWS credentials instead of long-lived keys.

Sources:

- GitHub OIDC for AWS: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services
- AWS credentials action: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/configure-aws-credentials-action-for-github-actions

### Deploy

In GitHub:

```text
Actions -> Deploy CloudRAG MVP -> Run workflow
```

Recommended inputs for experiments:

```text
stack_name: cloudrag-mvp
region: ap-south-1
project_name: cloudrag
environment_name: mvp
raw_bucket_name: leave blank, or provide a globally unique bucket name
db_ingress_cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
db_instance_class: db.t3.micro
```

The workflow:

1. Runs backend tests.
2. Packages Lambda ZIPs.
3. Uploads ZIPs to the artifact bucket.
4. Deploys CloudFormation.
5. Runs pgvector SQL setup against RDS.
6. Prints stack outputs.

### Destroy

In GitHub:

```text
Actions -> Destroy CloudRAG MVP -> Run workflow
```

This empties the stack-created raw bucket, deletes the stack, and waits for deletion. Use it after experiments to avoid RDS costs.

The artifact bucket from the bootstrap stack is intentionally not deleted by the app stack.

## IAM Summary

Use one Lambda execution role per function. Every role needs CloudWatch Logs permissions. Keep service permissions narrow:

- Upload URL: `dynamodb:PutItem` on documents table and `s3:PutObject` on `raw/*`.
- Document Status: `dynamodb:GetItem`, `dynamodb:UpdateItem`, and `s3:GetObject` on `raw/*`.
- Start Process: document read/update, process job put, `s3:GetObject`, and `sqs:SendMessage`.
- Process Status: `dynamodb:GetItem` on process jobs.
- Worker: consume SQS, read raw S3 objects, write processed S3 JSON, update DynamoDB document/job records, and VPC access if RDS is private.
- Retrieval and Ask: CloudWatch Logs, VPC access if RDS is private, and optional Secrets Manager read permissions.

Do not use administrator or full-access managed policies for the MVP.

## API Routes

Current Stage 1 routes:

- `POST /documents/upload-url`
- `GET /documents/{document_id}`
- `POST /documents/{document_id}/process`
- `GET /process/{process_id}/status`
- `POST /retrieval/query`
- `POST /ask`

The Ask API reuses shared retrieval logic directly. It does not call the Retrieval API over HTTP.

Current `/v1` auth routes:

- `POST /v1/auth/signup`
- `POST /v1/auth/confirm`
- `POST /v1/auth/login`
- `POST /v1/auth/refresh`
- `POST /v1/auth/logout`

Planned `/v1` routes are documented in [docs/api_contract.md](docs/api_contract.md). The target shape moves the primary product API from direct `/ask` calls to:

```text
create chat -> send message -> poll response -> inspect run trace
```

`/v1/ask` will remain as a compatibility wrapper over the new chat/message runtime flow.

## Manual Lambda Deployment Notes

Package each Lambda with the `shared/` directory and installed dependencies. The simple metadata handlers can usually use ZIP packages. The processing worker may be easier as a Lambda container image because `PyMuPDF` and `psycopg` include native dependencies.

Set `PROCESS_QUEUE_URL` for the start process handler. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and PostgreSQL variables for worker, retrieval, and ask.

If RDS is private, configure worker, retrieval, and ask Lambdas inside the VPC and attach `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole`.

## Postman Test Flow

Import `postman/cloudrag_mvp_collection.json`.

1. Generate upload URL with `POST /documents/upload-url`.
2. Upload the actual file directly to S3 using the returned presigned POST `url` and every returned `fields` value as form-data fields. Add the file as the final form-data file part.
3. Check `GET /documents/{document_id}`.
4. Start async processing with `POST /documents/{document_id}/process`.
5. Poll `GET /process/{process_id}/status`.
6. Query chunks with `POST /retrieval/query`.
7. Generate grounded answer with `POST /ask`.

## Troubleshooting

Upload URL works but S3 upload fails:

- Missing returned form fields in Postman.
- `Content-Type` does not exactly match the presigned policy.
- File size exceeds policy.
- Bucket name mismatch.

Document status does not update to `UPLOADED`:

- File was not uploaded to expected S3 key.
- Lambda lacks `s3:GetObject`.
- `document_id` is wrong.

Processing job stays `QUEUED`:

- SQS trigger is not attached to the worker.
- Worker Lambda permission issue.
- SQS message was not sent.
- Worker errors are visible in CloudWatch.

Worker fails while importing `PyMuPDF` or `psycopg`:

- Lambda package is missing native dependencies.
- Use a Lambda container image or Lambda layer.

Worker cannot connect to RDS:

- Lambda is not in the VPC.
- RDS security group does not allow the Lambda security group.
- Wrong DB endpoint or credentials.
- Subnet or route table issue.

Retrieval returns no chunks:

- Document was not processed successfully.
- pgvector table is empty.
- `user_id` mismatch.
- `document_ids` filter is wrong.
- Similarity threshold is too high.

Ask API returns insufficient context:

- Retrieval returned no chunks.
- Uploaded document content does not contain the answer.
- Prompt context is empty.

## Tests

```bash
pytest
```

Current tests cover validation, chunking, prompt building, and DOCX extraction.

## Future Upgrades

- Stage 2: `/v1` API contract, Pydantic schemas, global response format, and request context.
- Stage 3: Cognito auth and JWT-based `user_id` extraction.
- Stage 4: chat, message, run, memory, and trace metadata APIs.
- Stage 5: async runtime worker for chat messages.
- Stage 6: better retrieval with metadata filters, hybrid search, reranking, and chunk previews.
- Stage 7: optional web/API tool and chart artifact tool.
- Stage 8: observability with trace IDs, spans, prompt metadata, latency, token usage, cost estimate, and optional Langfuse/OTLP export.
- Stage 9: production networking, private RDS, stronger IAM, and deployment hardening.
